            "content": "# 1.2.1\n- fix version\n\n# 1.2.0\n- add `List.remove`\n- build with LiveScript 1.6.0\n- update dependencies\n- remove coverage calculation\n\n# 1.1.2\n- add `Func.memoize`\n- fix `zip-all` and `zip-with-all` corner case (no input)\n- build with LiveScript 1.4.0\n\n# 1.1.1\n- curry `unique-by`, `minimum-by`\n\n# 1.1.0\n- added `List` functions: `maximum-by`, `minimum-by`, `unique-by`\n- added `List` functions: `at`, `elem-index`, `elem-indices`, `find-index`, `find-indices`\n- added `Str` functions: `capitalize`, `camelize`, `dasherize`\n- added `Func` function: `over` - eg. ``same-length = (==) `over` (.length)``\n- exported `Str.repeat` through main `prelude` object\n- fixed definition of `foldr` and `foldr1`, the new correct definition is backwards incompatible with the old, incorrect one\n- fixed issue with `fix`\n- improved code coverage\n\n# 1.0.3\n- build browser versions\n\n# 1.0.2\n- bug fix for `flatten` - slight change with bug fix, flattens arrays only, not array-like objects\n\n# 1.0.1\n- bug fixes for `drop-while` and `take-while`\n\n# 1.0.0\n* massive update - separated functions into separate modules\n* functions do not accept multiple types anymore - use different versions in their respective modules in some cases (eg. `Obj.map`), or use `chars` or `values` in other cases to transform into a list\n* objects are no longer transformed into functions, simply use `(obj.)` in LiveScript to do that\n* browser version now using browserify - use `prelude = require('prelude-ls')`\n* added `compact`, `split`, `flatten`, `difference`, `intersection`, `union`, `count-by`, `group-by`, `chars`, `unchars`, `apply`\n* added `lists-to-obj` which takes a list of keys and list of values and zips them up into an object, and the converse `obj-to-lists`\n* added `pairs-to-obj` which takes a list of pairs (2 element lists) and creates an object, and the converse `obj-to-pairs`\n* removed `cons`, `append` - use the concat operator\n* removed `compose` - use the compose operator\n* removed `obj-to-func` - use partially applied access (eg. `(obj.)`)\n* removed `length` - use `(.length)`\n* `sort-by` renamed to `sort-with`\n* added new `sort-by`\n* removed `compare` - just use the new `sort-by`\n* `break-it` renamed `break-list`, (`Str.break-str` for the string version)\n* added `Str.repeat` which creates a new string by repeating the input n times\n* `unfold` as alias to `unfoldr` is no longer used\n* fixed up style and compiled with LiveScript 1.1.1\n* use Make instead of Slake\n* greatly improved tests\n\n# 0.6.0\n* fixed various bugs\n* added `fix`, a fixpoint (Y combinator) for anonymous recursive functions\n* added `unfoldr` (alias `unfold`)\n* calling `replicate` with a string now returns a list of strings\n* removed `partial`, just use native partial application in LiveScript using the `_` placeholder, or currying\n* added `sort`, `sortBy`, and `compare`\n\n# 0.5.0\n* removed `lookup` - use (.prop)\n* removed `call` - use (.func arg1, arg2)\n* removed `pluck` - use map (.prop), xs\n* fixed buys wtih `head` and `last`\n* added non-minifed browser version, as `prelude-browser.js`\n* renamed `prelude-min.js` to `prelude-browser-min.js`\n* renamed `zip` to `zipAll`\n* renamed `zipWith` to `zipAllWith`\n* added `zip`, a curried zip that takes only two arguments\n* added `zipWith`, a curried zipWith that takes only two arguments\n\n# 0.4.0\n* added `parition` function\n* added `curry` function\n* removed `elem` function (use `in`)\n* removed `notElem` function (use `not in`)\n\n# 0.3.0\n* added `listToObject`\n* added `unique`\n* added `objToFunc`\n* added support for using strings in map and the like\n* added support for using objects in map and the like\n* added ability to use objects instead of functions in certain cases\n* removed `error` (just use throw)\n* added `tau` constant\n* added `join`\n* added `values`\n* added `keys`\n* added `partial`\n* renamed `log` to `ln`\n* added alias to `head`: `first`\n* added `installPrelude` helper\n\n# 0.2.0\n* removed functions that simply warp operators as you can now use operators as functions in LiveScript\n* `min/max` are now curried and take only 2 arguments\n* added `call`\n\n# 0.1.0\n* initial public release\n"
