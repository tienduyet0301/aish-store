This is clear in the case of `<div>` and `<span>`. It is less so clear in the case of elements that _seem_ semantic, but that do not have a semantic mapping in the accessibility layer. For example `<a>`, `<big>`, `<blockquote>`, `<footer>`, `<picture>`, `<strike>` and `<time>` -- to name a few -- have no semantic layer mapping. They are as void of meaning as `<div>`.\n\nThe [WAI-ARIA `role` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#usage_intro) confers a semantic mapping to an element. The semantic value can then be expressed to a user via assistive technology.\n\nIn order to add interactivity such as a mouse or key event listener to a static element, that element must be given a role value as well.\n\n## How do I resolve this error?\n\n### Case: This element acts like a button, link, menuitem, etc\n\nIndicate the element's role with the `role` attribute:\n\n```jsx\n<div\n  onClick={onClickHandler}\n  onKeyPress={onKeyPressHandler}\n  role=\"button\"\n  tabindex=\"0\">\n  Save\n</div>\n```\n\nCommon interactive roles include:\n\n  1. `button`\n  1. `link`\n  1. `checkbox`\n  1. `menuitem`\n  1. `menuitemcheckbox`\n  1. `menuitemradio`\n  1. `option`\n  1. `radio`\n  1. `searchbox`\n  1. `switch`\n  1. `textbox`\n\nNote: Adding a role to your element does **not** add behavior. When a semantic HTML element like `<button>` is used, then it will also respond to Enter key presses when it has focus. The developer is responsible for providing the expected behavior of an element that the role suggests it would have: focusability and key press support.\n\n### Case: The event handler is only being used to capture bubbled events\n\nIf your element is catching bubbled click or key events from descendant elements, there are no appropriate roles for your element: you will have to deactivate the rule. Consider explaining the reason for disabling the rule as well.\n\n```jsx\n{/* The <div> element has a child <button> element that allows keyboard interaction */}\n{/* eslint-disable-next-line jsx-a11y/no-static-element-interactions */}\n<div onClick={this.handleButtonClick}>\n  <button>Save</button>\n  <button>Cancel</button>\n</div>\n```\n\nDo not use the role `presentation` on the element: it removes the element's semantics, and may also remove its children's semantics, creating big issues with assistive technology.\n\n## Rule options\n\nYou may configure which handler props should be taken into account when applying this rule. The recommended configuration includes the following 6 handlers and the `allowExpressionValues` option.\n\n```javascript\n'jsx-a11y/no-static-element-interactions': [\n  'error',\n  {\n    handlers: [\n      'onClick',\n      'onMouseDown',\n      'onMouseUp',\n      'onKeyPress',\n      'onKeyDown',\n      'onKeyUp',\n    ],\n    allowExpressionValues: true,\n  },\n],\n```\n\nAdjust the list of handler prop names in the handlers array to increase or decrease the coverage surface of this rule in your codebase.\n\nThe `allowExpressionValues` option determines whether the `role` attribute is allowed to be assigned using an expression. For example, the following would pass in recommended mode if `allowExpressionValues` is set to be `true`:\n\n```jsx\n<div role={ROLE_BUTTON} onClick={() => {}} />;\n// In case of a conditional expression, there should be literals on both sides of ternary operator\n<div role={isButton ? \"button\" : \"link\"} onClick={() => {}} />;\n```\n\n### Succeed\n\n```jsx\n<button onClick={() => {}} className=\"foo\" />\n<div className=\"foo\" onClick={() => {}} role=\"button\" />\n<input type=\"text\" onClick={() => {}} />\n```\n\n### Fail\n\n```jsx\n<div onClick={() => {}} />\n```\n\n## Accessibility guidelines\n\n- [WCAG 4.1.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value)\n\n### Resources\n\n- [WAI-ARIA `role` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#usage_intro)\n- [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide - Design Patterns and Widgets](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#aria_ex)\n- [Fundamental Keyboard Navigation Conventions](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#kbd_generalnav)\n- [Mozilla Developer Network - ARIA Techniques](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_button_role#Keyboard_and_focus)\n"
