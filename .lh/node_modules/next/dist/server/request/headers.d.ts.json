There are some cases where `headers()` cannot be automatically converted, namely\n * when it is used inside a synchronous function and we can't be sure the function can be made async automatically. In these cases we add an\n * explicit type case to `UnsafeUnwrappedHeaders` to enable typescript to allow for the synchronous usage only where it is actually necessary.\n *\n * You should should update these callsites to either be async functions where the `headers()` value can be awaited or you should call `headers()`\n * from outside and await the return value before passing it into this function.\n *\n * You can find instances that require manual migration by searching for `UnsafeUnwrappedHeaders` in your codebase or by search for a comment that\n * starts with `@next-codemod-error`.\n *\n * In a future version of Next.js `headers()` will only return a Promise and you will not be able to access the underlying Headers instance\n * without awaiting the return value first.
