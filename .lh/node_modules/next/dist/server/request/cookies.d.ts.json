The `UnsafeUnwrappedCookies` type is added to your code by a codemod that attempts to automatically\n * updates callsites to reflect the new Promise return type. There are some cases where `cookies()` cannot be automatically converted, namely\n * when it is used inside a synchronous function and we can't be sure the function can be made async automatically. In these cases we add an\n * explicit type case to `UnsafeUnwrappedCookies` to enable typescript to allow for the synchronous usage only where it is actually necessary.\n *\n * You should should update these callsites to either be async functions where the `cookies()` value can be awaited or you should call `cookies()`\n * from outside and await the return value before passing it into this function.\n *\n * You can find instances that require manual migration by searching for `UnsafeUnwrappedCookies` in your codebase or by search for a comment that\n * starts with `@next-codemod-error`.\n *\n * In a future version of Next.js `cookies()` will only return a Promise and you will not be able to access the underlying cookies object directly\n * without awaiting the return value first. When this change happens the type `UnsafeUnwrappedCookies` will be updated to reflect that is it no longer\n * usable.\n *\n * This type is marked deprecated to help identify it as target for refactoring away.\n *\n * @deprecated\n */\nexport type UnsafeUnwrappedCookies = ReadonlyRequestCookies;\nexport declare function cookies(): Promise<ReadonlyRequestCookies>;\n"
