The `UnsafeUnwrappedDraftMode` type is added to your code by a codemod that attempts to automatically\n * updates callsites to reflect the new Promise return type. There are some cases where `draftMode()` cannot be automatically converted, namely\n * when it is used inside a synchronous function and we can't be sure the function can be made async automatically. In these cases we add an\n * explicit type case to `UnsafeUnwrappedDraftMode` to enable typescript to allow for the synchronous usage only where it is actually necessary.\n *\n * You should should update these callsites to either be async functions where the `draftMode()` value can be awaited or you should call `draftMode()`\n * from outside and await the return value before passing it into this function.\n *\n * You can find instances that require manual migration by searching for `UnsafeUnwrappedDraftMode` in your codebase or by search for a comment that\n * starts with `@next-codemod-error`.\n *\n * In a future version of Next.js `draftMode()` will only return a Promise and you will not be able to access the underlying draftMode object directly\n * without awaiting the return value first. When this change happens the type `UnsafeUnwrappedDraftMode` will be updated to reflect that is it no longer\n * usable.\n *\n * This type is marked deprecated to help identify it as target for refactoring away.\n *\n * @deprecated\n */\nexport type UnsafeUnwrappedDraftMode = DraftMode;\nexport declare function draftMode(): Promise<DraftMode>;\ndeclare class DraftMode {\n    constructor(provider: null | DraftModeProvider);\n    get isEnabled(): boolean;\n    enable(): void;\n    disable(): void;\n}\nexport {};\n"
