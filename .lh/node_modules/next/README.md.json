Users are **highly encouraged** to read and adhere to them to avoid repercussions.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions to Next.js are welcome and highly appreciated. However, before you jump right into it, we would like you to review our [Contribution Guidelines](/contributing.md) to make sure you have a smooth experience contributing to Next.js.\n\n### Good First Issues:\n\nWe have a list of **[good first issues](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/labels/good%20first%20issue)** that contain bugs that have a relatively limited scope. This is a great place for newcomers and beginners alike to get started, gain experience, and get familiar with our contribution process.\n\n---\n\n## Security\n\nIf you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Next.js, we encourage you to **_responsibly disclose this and NOT open a public issue_**. We will investigate all legitimate reports.\n\nOur preference is that you make use of GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature to disclose potential security vulnerabilities in our Open Source Software. To do this, please visit [https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security) and click the \"Report a vulnerability\" button.\n"
