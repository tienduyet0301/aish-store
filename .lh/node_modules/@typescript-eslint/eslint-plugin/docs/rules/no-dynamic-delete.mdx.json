For example, some objects use \"hidden properties\" (such as `__data`) for private storage, and deleting them can break the object's internal state. Furthermore, [`delete`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete) cannot remove inherited properties or non-configurable properties. This makes it interact badly with anything more complicated than a plain object:\n\n- The [`length`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/length) of an array is non-configurable, and deleting it is a runtime error.\n- You can't remove properties on the prototype of an object, such as deleting methods from class instances.\n- Sometimes, `delete` only removes the own property, leaving the inherited property intact. For example, deleting the [`name`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/name) property of a function only removes the own property, but there's also a `Function.prototype.name` property that remains.\n\n## Examples\n\n<Tabs>\n<TabItem value=\"❌ Incorrect\">\n\n```ts\n// Dynamic, difficult-to-reason-about lookups\nconst name = 'name';\ndelete container[name];\ndelete container[name.toUpperCase()];\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n<TabItem value=\"✅ Correct\">\n\n```ts\nconst container: { [i: string]: number } = {\n  /* ... */\n};\n\n// Constant runtime lookups by string index\ndelete container.aaa;\n\n// Constants that must be accessed by []\ndelete container[7];\ndelete container[-1];\n\n// All strings are allowed, to be compatible with the noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature\n// TS compiler option\ndelete container['aaa'];\ndelete container['Infinity'];\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n</Tabs>\n\n## When Not To Use It\n\nWhen you know your keys are safe to delete, this rule can be unnecessary.\nYou might consider using [ESLint disable comments](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#using-configuration-comments-1) for those specific situations instead of completely disabling this rule.\n\nDo not consider this rule as performance advice before profiling your code's bottlenecks.\nEven repeated minor performance slowdowns likely do not significantly affect your application's general perceived speed.\n"
