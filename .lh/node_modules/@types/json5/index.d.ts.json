All of these are optional, and all of these come from ES5.\n\nObjects\n\nObject keys can be unquoted if they're valid identifiers. Yes, even reserved keywords (like default) are valid unquoted keys in ES5 [§11.1.5, §7.6]. (More info)\n\n(TODO: Unicode characters and escape sequences aren’t yet supported in this implementation.)\n\nObjects can have trailing commas.\n\nArrays\n\nArrays can have trailing commas.\nStrings\n\nStrings can be single-quoted.\n\nStrings can be split across multiple lines; just prefix each newline with a backslash. [ES5 §7.8.4]\n\nNumbers\n\nNumbers can be hexadecimal (base 16).\n\nNumbers can begin or end with a (leading or trailing) decimal point.\n\nNumbers can include Infinity, -Infinity, NaN, and -NaN.\n\nNumbers can begin with an explicit plus sign.\n\nComments\n\nBoth inline (single-line) and block (multi-line) comments are allowed.\n  */\ndeclare var json5: JSON;\nexport = json5;\n"
